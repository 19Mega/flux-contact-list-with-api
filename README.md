# Contact Managment Application 

Technologies: HTML, CSS, JS, React, React Router and Flux.

Hello! It is time to start doing professional front-end applications. This time
we will be creating a small contact management application that allows users to:
Create, Update, Delete and Read contacts.

***Please use the Flux architecture for this:*** The Flux architecture is one of the most used proposal for web application architetures.

How to start?
Download the boilerplate, it contains all no real functionalities, 
but it has 99.99% of the HTML and CSS you will need for the project
allowing you to focus on the functionality only.

The project is divided in, two different views: 
1. Contact: Contains the list of contacts.
2. AddContact: It's just a form that you can use to create or update contatcs.

And two different components:
1. ContactCard: Ideal component to display just one contact.
2. Modal: Show and hide the confirmation modal and listen to the user answer (confirmation or cancellation).

## Steps to install this project

##### 1. Clone the repository
```
$ breathecode start:flux -r
```
##### 2. Install the node_modules
```
$ npm install
```
##### 3. Run the webpack development server
```
$ npm run c9
```

That is it! Start coding your ReactJS+Flux application.
